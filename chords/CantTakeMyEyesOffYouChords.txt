[Verse 1]
 
                D
You're just too good to be true
              Dmaj7
Can't take my eyes off you
              D7sus4
You'd be like heaven to touch
        G
I wanna hold you so much
              Gm
At long last love has arrived
            D
And I thank God I'm alive
                E              Em
You're just too good to be true
              D
Can't take my eyes off you
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
           D
Pardon the way that I stare
                Dmaj7
There's nothing else to compare
             D7sus4
The sight of you leaves me weak
                   G
There are no words left to speak
          Gm
So if you feel like I feel
              D
Please let me know that it's real
                E              Em
You're just too good to be true
              D
Can't take my eyes off of you

I need you baby, to warm the lonely nights
           Em    A7                 D   B7#9
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
