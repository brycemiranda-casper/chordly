Every breath you take, every move you make
                D                    E
Every bond you break, every step you take
                 F#m

              A                 F#m
Every single day, every word you say
                D                    E
Every game you play, every night you stay
                 F#m
I'll be watching you

              D
Oh can't you see
C              A                      B
You belong to me how my poor heart aches
                     E
With every step you take
 
 
[Verse]
 
                A                  F#m
Every move you make, every vow you break
                 D                     E
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
                 F#m
I'll be watching you
 
 
[Bridge]
 
F
Since you've been gone, I've been lost without a trace
G
I dream at night I can only see your face
F
I look around but it's you I can't replace
G
I feel so cold I long for your embrace
F                           A
I keep crying baby, baby please

You belong to me, how my poor heart aches
