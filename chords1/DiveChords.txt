[Intro]
E - - -| C#m  - A B
 
[Verse 1]
        E
Maybe I came on too strong
        C#m              A    B
Maybe I waited too long
          E
Maybe I played my cards wrong
 
Oh, just a little bit wrong
     C#m              A    B
Baby I apologize for it
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A                         C#m
I could fall, or I could fly
                       G#m
Here in your aeroplane
 
And I could live, I could die
A
Hanging on the words you say
     A                         C#m
And I’ve been known to give my all
 
And jumping in harder than
B
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
 
[Chorus]
                 E
So don’t call me baby
           C#m      A
Unless you mean it
      B           E
Don’t tell me you need me
                 C#m
If you don’t believe it
   A               B
So let me know the truth
   C#m     B        B/D#  E
Before I dive right into you
 
 
[Verse 2]
          E
You’re a mystery
                                    C#m                A      B
I have travelled the world, there’s no other girl like you
                    E
No one, what’s your history?
                                    C#m
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
          A          B
‘Cause I heard you do, mm
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A                         C#m
I could fall, or I could fly
                       G#m
Here in your aeroplane
 
And I could live, I could die
A
Hanging on the words you say
     A                         C#m
And I’ve been known to give my all
 
And lie awake, every day
B
Don't know how much I can take
 
 
[Chorus]
                 E
So don’t call me baby
           C#m      A
Unless you mean it
      B           E
Don’t tell me you need me
                 C#m
If you don’t believe it
   A               B
So let me know the truth
   C#m     B        B/D#  E
Before I dive right into you
 
[Solo]
E - - -| C#m  - A B x2
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A                         C#m
I could fall, or I could fly
                       G#m
Here in your aeroplane
 
And I could live, I could die
A
Hanging on the words you say
     A                         C#m
And I’ve been known to give my all
 
Sitting back, looking at
B
Every mess that I've made
 
[Chorus]
                 E
So don’t call me baby
           C#m      A
Unless you mean it
      B           E
Don’t tell me you need me
                 C#m
If you don’t believe it
   A               B
So let me know the truth
   C#m     B        B/D#  E
Before I dive right into you
   C#m     B        B/D#  E
Before I dive right into you
C#m        B        B/D#  E
Before I dive right into you
